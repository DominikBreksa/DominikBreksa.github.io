My name is Dominik, and I have created this site for my university course. Enoy your stay here

### My favrite programing language is C++

Everyone konws about C++, here. :)

#### Example of a C++ code
```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main ()
{
cout << "Hello World!";
return 0;
}
```
Also don't remember that it is C++, not C++ :)

### I'm interested in Polish railways :)
